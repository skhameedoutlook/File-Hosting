# File-Hosting-Frontend

A front-end engineering project, which contains a hierarchical file system and a clean, usable UI built in entirely in pure javascript.

Some of the things that can be performed in the filesystem through the UI are, adding, editing, organizing, and searching for files and folders.

A modern desktop type navigation is provided.
Also, two view modes are available:
1) Grid-View mode(default)
2) List-View mode

For those interested in testing/exploring: 

-> Use a single click for opening a new directory.

-> To delete files/folders:
1) Switch to select mode(click on select mode button on top-right)
2) Select files/folders using single click(Click again to deselct)
3) Click Delete

-> Other functions are intuitive and need no explanation.
